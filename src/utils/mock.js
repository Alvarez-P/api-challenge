const mock = `Vice President Johnson Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower,
Vice President Nixon, President Truman, Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:

We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom --
symbolizing an end as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal as well as
change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our
forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.

The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power
to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet
the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at
issue around the globe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from the
generosity of the state but from the hand of God.

We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let
the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the
torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans -- born in this century,
tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient
heritage -- and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human
rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are
committed today at home and around the world.

Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay
any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose
any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.`
